# minerals-identification
The main aim is to obtain a capable prediction by the machine learning algorithmic characteristics, which can figure out if the target of the sound wave is either a rock or a mine or any other organism or any kind of other body.By using SONAR dataset and KNN techniques to identify the minerals and group them accordingly.Machine learning is performing a major role in improving the quality of detection of natural resources, and will tend be better in the future.

In the recent years there is vast development in mining industries but still we are facing many difficulties in identifying the minerals.So, to overcome this problem nowadays SONAR is used for detection of minerals.During the usage of the SONAR, Radio Frequencies are emitted from the SONAR this frequencies hit the minerals and reflect back to the surface.During reflection, a large number of numeric values are recorded. So, Computerised technique is required.Hence, we are using Machine Learning(ML) Algorithm for detection of minerals.
